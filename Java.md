Why use Java interface?
There are mainly three reasons to use interface. They are given below.

1. It is used to achieve abstraction.
2. By interface, we can support the functionality of multiple inheritance.
3. It can be used to achieve loose coupling.

A class extends another class, an interface extends another interface, but a class implements an interface.
